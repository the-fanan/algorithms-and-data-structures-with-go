QUICK GO REFERENCE
==================
## Array
```go
var x [5] int
var x [5][5] int
var x = [5]int{1,2,3,4,5}
x := [5]int{1,2,3,4,5}
```

## Slice
```go
var s = []int{1,2,3}
s := make([]int,10) //creaate a slice with length of 10 (10 slots) and each value is 0
s := make([]int,5,10) // create a slice with length of 5 and capacity of 10
s2 := s[n:m+1] // create new slice from old slice. n = indes you want to start from, m = index to end
```

## Map
```go
m := make(map[string]int)
delete(m, "key")
val, ok := m["key"] //if key does not exist ok will be false
key, value := range m //to be used in a loop
```
## String
```go
s := "Fanan"
b := []byte(s) //convert s to byte
s[i] // accesses the character at index i of s. It is returned as byte.

//import the strings library
strings.Split(s, character)
strings.ToLowerCase(s)
```

PROBLEM SOLVING PATTERNS
===========================
1. Multiple Pointers - most cases, array must be sorted
2. Frequency counter - use maps to avoid nested loops
3. Window Slider - Used for a subset of data that exhibits a continuous property

MATH TIPS
============
1. (idx % N) will wrap around an array preventing the need of an IF statement
2. x + (y - (x % y)) - next highest multiple of x from y
2. n * (n + 1) / 2 total number of possible substrings of a string. It also returns sum of numbers from 0 to n
2. n * (n-2)/2 gives you number of palindromes in a repeated string
3. For any number K, the sum of 2 values (A & B) is evenly divisible by K if the sum of the remainders of A/K + B/K is K
That is if (A%K) + (B%K) == K
3. P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
3. If A and B are mutually exclusive (e.g., if one happens, the other one canâ€™t), P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
3. In general), P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
3. P(B given A) = P(A and B) / P(A)

PITFALLS
===========
1. Try not to confuse SUB-SET, SUB-SEQUENCE, SUB-ARRAY / SUB-STRING
SUB-SET => Any group of characters picked can suffice
SUB-SEQUENCE => characters must come after one another but not immediately (e.g. For Fanan - Fnn, Fan, Fn is a subsequence not nanF)
SUB-ARRAY/SUB-STRING => any group of elements that follow each other sequentially (e.g. For Fanan - Fan, anam nan, Fana)
